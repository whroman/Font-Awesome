#Font Awesome ++

Fork of the aptly-named [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome), specifically to add a Meetup icon, since Font Awesome itself does not take pull requests with icons.  I may add other icons as well, as various projects require.  

Usage is exactly the same as the original Font Awesome (documentation [here](http://fontawesome.io/)), with the additional icon accessed with:

     <i class-"fa fa-meeup"></i>
